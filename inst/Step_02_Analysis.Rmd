# Purpose
This file analyzes data derived from publicly archived data files (Campbell,
2019) to produce outputs for a descriptive paper about the criminal histories of
suspected serial sexual perpetrators.^[In this document, we use the terms
perpetrator and offender interchangeably. Both terms should be interpreted as
referring to individuals suspected of committing a crime but we occasionally
omit that qualifier for the sake of brevity.] The data come from Detroit, MI.

# Notes on Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) Results
Numerous sections below contain output for GEE models and estimates derived from
them, such as estimated marginal means and contrasts for ratios of those means.
We performed those analyses because we think the contrasts provide useful
insights into how much offenders' rates of criminal activity differed between
the periods before versus after the testing window. Reviewers found them less
relevant than we did. We have left those results in the research compendium
despite having removed them from the final manuscript because some readers may
still find them interesting and relevant. Preserving them facilitates achieving
transparency regarding all the analyses we conducted.

# Setup
Set global R chunk options (local chunk options will over-ride global options). 
The method for creating a size option that controls font size in code chunks and
their text output is based on an answer to a question posted on   
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25646333/code-chunk-font-size-in-rmarkdown-with-knitr-and-latex/46526740#46526740). 

``` {r global_options, cfsize = "footnotesize"}
# Create a custom chunk hook/option for controlling font size in chunk & output.
def.chunk.hook  <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("chunk")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) {
  x <- def.chunk.hook(x, options)
  ifelse(options$cfsize != "normalsize", paste0("\n \\", options$cfsize,"\n\n", 
                                              x, "\n\n \\normalsize"), x)
  })

# Global chunk options (over-ridden by local chunk options)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include  = TRUE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, 
                      message = TRUE, warning = TRUE, cfsize = "footnotesize")

# Declare location of this script relative to the project root directory.
here::i_am(path = "inst/Step_02_Analysis.Rmd")
```

Load R packages that we need to get additional functions. 

``` {r load_packages}
library(here)             # for here()
library(plyr)             # For mapvalues()
library(dplyr)            # for %>%, filter(), group_by(), & summarise()
library(tidyr)            # for arrange(), filter(), group_by(), mutate(),  
                          # spread(), summarise(), %>%, etc. 
library(rmarkdown)        # for render()
library(knitr)            # for kable()
options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)
library(kableExtra)       # for kable_styling(), add_header_above(), column_spec(),
                          # collapse_rows(), and landscape()

library(ggplot2)          # for ggplot()
library(ggdist)           # for stat_halfeye()
```

Create objects to hold settings we plan to reuse often. 

```{r my_settings}
# Custom settings for use with bwplot().
my.boxes <- list(box.rectangle = list(col = "black", lwd = 2), 
                 box.umbrella = list(col = "black", lwd = 2))
```

# Load Data 
The chunk below loads the data saved by the prior script *Step_01_Data_Mgt.Rmd*.

```{r load_data}
load(file = here::here("data/CHR_Data.RData"))

# Offender-Level Summaries
We have few offender-level demographic variables that are worth reporting (we 
will omit summarizing height, weight, hair color, & eye color). After examining
sex, race, and age, we switch focus to looking at descriptive data about the 
criminal history records for arrests, prosecutor charges, and adjudicated 
charges. 

```{r sample_sizes}
# Store objects with sample sizes we will reuse often later. 
N_All    <- IDNEW %>% nrow()
N_Before <- IDNEW %>% filter(Years_Before > 0) %>% nrow()
N_During <- IDNEW %>% filter(Years_During > 0) %>% nrow()
N_After  <- IDNEW %>% filter(Years_After > 0) %>% nrow()

data.frame(N_All, N_Before, N_During, N_After)
```

All the CHR summaries in this section focus on variables that have been 
aggregated to the offender level. That is why the sample size for all of these
variables is N = `r format(N_All, big.mark = ",")` (the number of offenders for 
whom Michigan CHR data were available and the start date for the earliest SAK
testing window could be established).

age at the start of the earliest testing window and at the time of CHR

for both of these age variables.

      col.names = CNames, row.names = FALSE,

FCap <- paste("\\label{fig:boxplot_Age}",
              "Box Plots for Offender Age. Only offenders with valid testing",

              "years (the start of observed adult CHR data). CHR collection",
              "occurred on 04/15/2016 for all offfenders.",
              "CHR, criminal history record; SAK, sexual assault kit.")

  pivot_longer(cols = -OID, names_to = "VName", values_to = "Age") %>%

                         labels = c("At earliest SAK", "At CHR collection"))) %>%

## CHR Periods
The observed portions of these offenders' adult criminal histories include 
incident, arrest, prosecutor charge, and judicial charge records associated with
crimes that occurred between the offender's 16th birthday and April 15, 2016
(when the CHR data were collected from the official statewide CHR database). 
That time frame can be divided into three important periods for the purposes of
this study: before, during, and after the testing window associated with the 
offender's earliest sexual assault kit (SAK). Here we provide descriptive data 
about those periods. Note that the relative timing of an offender's earliest SAK
relative to their 16th birthday controls how much of the before and during
periods were observed versus unobserved. Figures \ref{fig:boxplot_Age16Date} and 
\ref{fig:boxplot_WDate} respectively show boxplots for the date of the offenders
16th birthday and the start date of the earliest testing window (which is the 
date the earliest SAK was collected). 

```{r boxplot_Age16Date, fig.height = 1.75, fig.width = 7, fig.cap=FCap}
# Figure caption.
FCap <- paste("\\label{fig:boxplot_Age16Date}",
              "Box Plot for Date of Offender's 16th Birthday. Only offenders", 
              "with valid testing window start dates are included.",
              "These dates mark the start of the observed adult criminal",
              "history record for each offender.")

bwplot(~ Age16Date, data = IDNEW, factor = 9, 
       xlim = c(ymd("1948-01-01"), ymd("2012-12-31")),
       panel = panel.mybox, par.settings = my.boxes,
       xlab = "Offender's 16th Birthday")
```

```{r boxplot_WDate, fig.height = 1.75, fig.width = 7, fig.cap=FCap}
# Figure caption.
FCap <- paste("\\label{fig:boxplot_WDate}",
              "Box Plot for Start Date of Earliest Testing Window. Only", 
              "offenders with valid testing window start dates are included.")

bwplot(~ WDate, data = IDNEW, factor = 9, 
       xlim = c(ymd("1984-01-01"), ymd("2016-12-31")),
       panel = panel.mybox, par.settings = my.boxes,
       xlab = "Start of Earliest Testing Window")
```

Those dates were used in the previous data management script to compute the 
durations of the observed portions of adult CHR that correspond to the periods 
before, during, and after the earliest testing window. Table
\ref{tab:describe_windows} shows descriptive statistics for the these durations
and \ref{fig:boxplot_windows} shows corresponding boxplots. These provide 
crucial context for interpreting the numbers of crimes observed in each of those 
periods and provide the denominators for translating them into incidence rates. 

```{r describe_windows}
# Table caption.
TCap <- paste("Observed Period Durations (Years)")
# Footnote text.
FN <- paste0("Only offenders with valid testing window start dates are ", 
             "included. ",
             "TW, earliest testing window.")

rlabs <- c("Before TW", "During TW", "After TW")

IDNEW %>%

  footnote(general = FN, general_title = "Note: ", footnote_as_chunk = TRUE,
         threeparttable = TRUE)
```

              "years, which is the start of observed adult CHR, which was ",
              "collected on 04/15/2016.",
              "TW, earliest testing window.")

IDNEW %>% 
  select(OID, Years_Before, Years_During, Years_After) %>% 
  # Rearrange data so we can easily plot multiple variables. 
  pivot_longer(cols = -OID, names_to = "VName", values_to = "Duration") %>% 
  mutate(VName = ordered(VName, 
                         levels = rev(c("Years_Before", "Years_During",
                                        "Years_After")), 
                         labels = rev(rlabs))) %>%

       panel = panel.mybox, par.settings = my.boxes, 
       xlab = "Observed Period Duration (Years)")
```

## CHR Record Counts
We aggregated data to count how many CHR records of each type are associated
with each offender. Here we are counting only records associated with incidents
for which the offender was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of at least
one offense from the 12 main crime categories. We summarize the resulting
variables (*NINC12*, *NARR12*, *NCHG12*, *NJUD12*, & *NCON12*) below. Table
\ref{tab:describe_rcvars} provides overall descriptive statistics for all record
types, plus summaries broken down by when the associated incidents occurred
relative to the testing window.

Only the data about incident records counts from Table \ref{tab:describe_rcvars} 
is directly reported in the manuscript. The numbers about other types of records
are contextual information about the volume of data that was available. 

```{r describe_rcvars}

            "from one of the 12 main crime categories were counted.",
            "Before, during, and after refer to when the incident associated",
            "with the record occurred, not when the arrest date, charge date,",

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r NINC12_gee}
NINC12_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  # Keep only observations for observed periods (i.e., those with Years > 0).
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(NINC12 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

NINC12_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(NINC12 ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

Table \ref{tab:NINC12_texreg} below shows the parameter estimates for both GEE
models.

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:NINC12_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

```{r NINC12_emmeans}
# Table caption.
TCap <- paste("Marginal Means of Incident Counts and Incidence Rates",
              "By When Incidents Occurred")

# Table footnote.
FN <- paste("Model 1 did not use an offset, so means are counts.",
            "Model 2 used log(Years) as an offset term, so means are annual",
            "incidence rates.",
            "Confidence intervals are based on z-scores.")

NINC12_emmeans1 <- emmeans(NINC12_gee1, specs = pairwise ~ When, 
                           type = "response", ref = "During")

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means
Finally, we also estimated a set of contrasts to compare the marginal means from
Models 1 and 2 (Table \ref{tab:NINC12_ratios}). Each of these contrasts
estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

TCap <- paste("Contrasts Estimating Ratios of Marginal Means for Incident",
              "Counts and Incidence Rates By When Incidents Occurred")

## Crime Category Counts (Arrested, Charged, or Convicted)
Table \ref{tab:describe_cccvars} summarizes how many of 12 different crime 
categories each offender was *arrested for, charged with, or convicted of*
according to the CHR data. This sums a set of binary transforms on the incident
count variables associated with each crime category in *HXCat12*. It is possible
to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or conviction records 
for a specific category, but we only count each distinct category once at most.
The *Excluded user-missing* value is not counted as a category, so the possible
range of values for these counts is 0-12. We report both overall results, and
results broken down by when the incidents associated with the arrest, charge,
and conviction records occurred relative to the earliest testing window. Table \ref{tab:freq_HXCat12_Count} shows the frequency distributions underlying those
summaries.

### GEE Models
To more closely examine the crime category counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r cccvar_gee}
cccvar_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  # Keep only observations for observed periods (i.e., those with Years > 0).
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_Count ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

cccvar_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_Count ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

Table \ref{tab:cccvar_texreg} below shows the parameter estimates for both GEE
models. 

```{r cccvar_texreg, results = "asis", cfsize = "normalsize"}

### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:cccvar_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

```{r cccvar_emmeans}
# Table caption.
TCap <- paste("Marginal Means of Crime Category Counts and Incidence Rates",
              "By When Incidents Occurred")

# Table footnote.
FN <- paste("Model 1 did not use an offset, so means are counts.",

            "incidence rates.",
            "Confidence intervals are based on z-scores.")

cccvar_emmeans2 <- emmeans(cccvar_gee2, specs = pairwise ~ When,

as_tibble(cccvar_emmeans1$emmeans) %>% 
  full_join(x = ., y = as_tibble(cccvar_emmeans2$emmeans)) %>% 
  mutate(Model = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2), 
         When = factor(When, levels = c("Before", "During", "After"))) %>%

### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means
Finally, we also estimated a set of contrasts to compare the marginal means from
Models 1 and 2 (Table \ref{tab:cccvar_ratios}). Each of these contrasts
estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

```{r cccvar_ratios}
TCap <- paste("Contrasts Estimating Ratios of Marginal Means for Crime",
              "Category Counts and Incidence Rates By When Incidents",
              "Occurred")

            "These contrasts estimate ratios of those quantities and used",
            "Tukey's method to adjust for multiple comparisons.",
            "Confidence intervals are based on z-scores.")

## Incident Counts by Crime Category (12 levels) and Period
In this section, we analyze variables that contain the number of unique 
incidents in the offender's criminal history for a given type of crime. For each
category of crime, we report include counts of incidents based on a combined 
criterion where the offender was *arrested for, charged with, or convicted of* 
(any of the three events, or any combination of them) crimes classified into the
relevant category.

Note that these variables were created by first aggregating *ARR*, *CHG*, and
*JUD* records to the incident level to flag incidents that fit the relevant
category, then aggregated again to get to the offender level incident counts. It
is possible to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or
adjudication records for convictions on a single incident, but these variables
ignore that and only count each incident once.

It may be helpful to note that the order of subsections below follows the 
numerical coding of the categories (which was influenced by alphabetical order
of the labels we chose). We grouped and presented results in a different order 
in the manuscript that we think makes the material easier to present to readers.
So, in comparing these materials to the published paper, pay attention to the 
crime category labels and section headings.

The chunk below creates some objects we use to dynamically construct text later 
in the subsections below.

#### Estimated Marginal Means

measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the assault involving domestic violence and/or stalking
incident counts, we fitted two generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to
the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after dropping rows for unobserved periods
(*Years* = 0) because the counts are missing for those observations.

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_2_gee}
HXCat12_2_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>%

  geeglm(HXCat12_2 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_3_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained

measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the burglary incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_4_gee}
HXCat12_4_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_4 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_4_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_4 ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

#### Overlap Between During Period Incidents and Earliest Known SAKs
The earliest known SAKs come from a different data source than the criminal
history records. Those SAKs were tested long after most of the offenders’
criminal history records had accumulated. It is possible that some or even all 
of the criminal sexual conduct incidents found in the offenders' criminal 
histories during the testing window represent the same event as the earliest
known SAK that starts the testing window. It is also possible that some or all
of the criminal sexual conduct incidents in the criminal histories are entirely 
different events that show repeat offending behavior within a short period of
time. Therefore, below we assess how much overlap there is between the earliest
SAKs that define when the testing windows start and the CSC incidents from the
criminal histories that occur during that period.

We start by examining criminal sexual conduct incident records. On these
records, the *IID* variable is a primary key used for uniquely identifying each
incident, the *ESAK_IID* variable on an incident record contains the IID
associated with the offender's earliest known SAK, and *IWhen* classifies each
incident as occurring before, during, or after the testing window associated
with the offender's earliest known SAK. When *IID* = *ESAK_IID*, the incident
record overlaps with the earliest known SAK. So, Table 
\ref{tab:crosstab_overlap} shows how many CSC incident records there are in each
*IWhen* period that overlap with the earliest SAK.

```{r crosstab_overlap}
# Create tibble with only CSC incident records. 
INCEW %>% 
  filter(HXCat12_5 == 1) %>% 
  mutate(Overlap = (ESAK_IID == IID)) ->

  add_header_above(c("", "Overlap Earliest SAK" = 2, "")) %>%
  column_spec(2:4, width = "1.6cm") 
```

All of the overlap incidents should occur during the testing window and that is
consistent with what we see in Table \ref{tab:crosstab_overlap}. Therefore, we 
move on to extract a few key numbers and do some additional computations to 
quantify the degree of overlap. 

```{r n_overlap1}
# No. of CSC incidents observed (all periods). 
INCEW_CSC %>% nrow() -> N_ICSC
N_ICSC

# No. of CSC incidents observed during testing window. 
INCEW_CSCD %>% nrow() -> N_ICSCD
N_ICSCD

# No. of unique offenders with >=1 CSC incident in CHR
INCEW_CSC %>% pull(OID) %>% unique() %>% length() -> N_OCSC
N_OCSC

# No. of unique offenders with >=1 CSC incident in CHR during testing window
INCEW_CSCD %>% pull(OID) %>% unique() %>% length() -> N_OCSCD 
N_OCSCD

# No. of unique offenders whose earliest SAK overlaps a CSC incident in CHR
# There is a maximum of one overlap incident per offender, so this is also the
# number of unique overlap CSC incidents.
INCEW_CSC %>% filter(ESAK_IID == IID) %>% pull(OID) %>% unique() %>% length() ->
  N_Overlap
N_Overlap
```
From an incident perspective, there were a total of `r N_ICSC` CSC incidents 
in the criminal history data, but only `r N_ICSCD` 
(`r round(100*N_ICSCD/N_ICSC, digits = 2)`%) of them occurred during an 
offender's testing window. The `r N_Overlap` incidents that overlap with the 
offender's earliest known SAK comprise 
`r round(100*N_Overlap/N_ICSC, digits = 2)`% of all the CSC incidents and 
`r round(100*N_Overlap/N_ICSCD, digits = 2)`% of the CSC incidents that occurred
during testing windows. So, most of the CSC incidents that occurred during an
offender’s testing window are linked to the very SAK that started the testing
window itself.

Meanwhile, from an offender perspective, there are `r N_OCSC` offenders 
(`r round(100*N_OCSC/N_All, digits = 2)`% of the sample) with at least one CSC
incident in their criminal history records. However, only `r N_OCSCD` 
(`r round(100*N_OCSCD/N_All, digits = 2)`%) offenders have one or more CSC 
incidents in their criminal history that specifically fall during their testing
window. Further subsetting shows that there are `r N_Overlap` offenders for whom
we believe the earliest known SAK can be linked to a specific CSC incident from
their criminal history data. They comprise 
`r round(100*N_Overlap/N_All, digits = 2)`% of the full sample and 
`r round(100*N_Overlap/N_OCSCD, digits = 2)`% of the subset of offenders who had
at least one CSC incident during the testing window according to the criminal
history records.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the criminal sexual conduct incident counts, we fitted
two generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL*
data, after dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the
counts are missing for those observations.

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_5_gee}
HXCat12_5_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_5 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_5_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_5 ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_5_texreg} below shows the parameter estimates for both 
GEE models.

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_5_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

```{r HXCat12_5_emmeans}
# Table caption.

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means
Finally, we also estimated a set of contrasts to compare the marginal means from
Models 1 and 2 (Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_5_ratios}). Each of these contrasts
estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

TCap <- paste("Contrasts Estimating Ratios of Marginal Means for Criminal",

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the homicide incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_7_gee}
HXCat12_7_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_7 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_7_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_7 ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_7_texreg} below shows the parameter estimates for both 
GEE models.

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_7_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means
Finally, we also estimated a set of contrasts to compare the marginal means from
Models 1 and 2 (Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_7_ratios}). Each of these contrasts
estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the robbery incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_9_gee}
HXCat12_9_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_9 ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_9_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_9 ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_9_texreg} below shows the parameter estimates for both 
GEE models.

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_9_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means

estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator.

#### Estimated Marginal Means

measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the weapon incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_12_gee}

## Incident Counts by Broader Crime Category (4 levels) and Period
In this section, we analyze variables that contain the number of unique 
incidents in the offender's criminal history for a given broader category of 
crime. The numerical results for broader categories were omitted from the paper
for the sake of brevity, but we retain them here for future reference. 

For each broader crime category, we report include counts of incidents based on 
a combined criterion where the offender was 
*arrested for, charged with, or convicted of* (any of the three events, or any 
combination of them) any of the more specific types of crimes classified into 
the relevant category.

Note that these variables were created by first aggregating *ARR*, *CHG*, and
*JUD* records to the incident level to flag incidents that fit the relevant
category, then aggregated again to get to the offender level incident counts. It
is possible to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or
adjudication records for convictions on a single incident, but these variables
ignore that and only count each incident once.

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_Sexual_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means

Models 1 and 2 (Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_Sexual_ratios}). Each of these contrasts
estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the violent, non-sexual crimes incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_Violent_gee}
HXCat12_Violent_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_Violent ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_Violent_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_Violent ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = .,

#### Estimated Marginal Means
Table \ref{tab:HXCat12_Property_emmeans} provides the estimated marginal means obtained
from Models 1 and 2, along with corresponding confidence intervals. The units of
measurement for those means are counts per offender for Model 1 (which ignore
period duration) and counts per offender-year for Model 2 (which adjust for
duration and are thus considered annual incidence rates).

#### Contrasts for Ratios of Estimated Marginal Means
Finally, we also estimated a set of contrasts to compare the marginal means from

estimates the ratios of a pair of means rather than a raw difference between
means. This is because of the nature of the underlying Poisson GEE model.

#### GEE Models
To more closely examine the other crimes incident counts, we fitted two generalized
estimating equation (GEE) models to the long-format *IDNEWL* data, after
dropping rows for unobserved periods (*Years* = 0) because the counts are
missing for those observations. 

Model 1 used *When* as a predictor of the period-specific counts, but did not
adjust for the period durations. Model 2 supplemented *When* as a predictor with
an offset term for log(*Years*) to adjust for the period durations. Both models
used Poisson distributions, an exchangeable correlation structure, a log link
function, and robust standard errors based on the sandwich estimator. 

```{r HXCat12_Other_gee}
HXCat12_Other_gee1 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>%
  geeglm(HXCat12_Other ~ When, 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")

HXCat12_Other_gee2 <- IDNEWL %>% 
  filter(Years > 0) %>% 
  geeglm(HXCat12_Other ~ When + offset(log(Years)), 
         family = poisson(link = "log"), data = ., 
         id = OID, corstr = "exchangeable", std.err = "san.se")
```

GEE models.

## After Period Summary
Next we summarize the amount of crime that occurred after the testing window.
Separately for each crime category, Table \ref{tab:after_summary} shows the
number of offenders with one or more incidents from the given category. It also
translates those offender counts into percentages relative to the total sample
size and reports the total number of incidents associated with those offenders
that occurred after the testing window ended.

### Incident Count Distributions By Crime Categeory
Figure \ref{fig:plot_Crime_full_width} plots the distributions of the incident
count variables for each of the 12 main crime categories during the period after
the testing window. Because a few large outlier values make the details harder
to see for the majority of the data (nearly all values are for 12 or fewer
incidents), we also produced Figure \ref{fig:plot_Crime_partial_width}, which 
zooms in on the 0-12 range of incident counts.

### Years to Incident Date Distributions by Crime Category
Table \ref{tab:describe_IYearsAfterTW} shows descriptive statistics about the 
distribution for *IYearsAfterTW*, which records how many years after the end of 
the testing window an incident actually occurred, broken down by crime category. 
This is particularly useful for identifying the median (Q50) and quartiles (Q25 
and Q75), which clearly vary across types of crime.

Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf} shows the cumulative distribution
functions for the number of years elapsed between the end of the testing window
and each incident that occurred after the window ended, broken down by crime
category. This is useful because the number of preventable incidents depends on
when after the end of the testing window the offender reference sample gets
uploaded to CODIS. This figure is an alternative way to visualize the same data
shown in Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime} as a cumulative density up to
a given number of years rather than the point density at each time point. The
medians (Q50) shown in Table \ref{tab:describe_IYearsAfterTW} are number of
years on the horizontal axis of \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf} where
the line rises to the 50% mark on the vertical axis. Similarly, the 25th and
75th quantiles (Q25 and Q75) are where the line rises to the 25% and 75% marks
on the vertical axis.

Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf} was the original version of a  
figure we submitted in a revision to our manuscript. Reviewers found it 
confusing, so we created Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf2}
as a replacement when resubmitting the manuscript. The cumulative density at any 
given number of years after the end of the testing window is the proportion of
incidents that had already occurred by that time. Switching to a focus on the 
proportion remaining instead more closely aligns with the number of potentially 
preventable incidents. We also improved the labeling of the axes and the figure
caption to address reviewer comments and make the figure easier to understand.

### Number of Potentially Preventable Incidents by Crime Category
Now we extract the empirical cumulative distribution functions data underlying
Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf} and use them to prepare Table
\ref{tab:table_IYearsAfterTW_ecdf}. A reviewer noted that uploading an offender
DNA profile from a SAK to CODIS can only produce immediate identification of the
offender if the corresponding offender reference sample was already present in
CODIS beforehand. However, that may not always happen. The offender reference
sample that allows identifying the offender associated with SAK may not arrive
in CODIS until later. That means there could be a delay between uploading the
SAK forensic testing results to CODIS as a forensic sample and getting a match
to an offender. Incidents occurring between the end of the testing window and
the arrival of a matching offender reference sample cannot be prevented through
timely response to CODIS search results that are not yet available. Only crimes
occurring after a match is available could be prevented that way.

It would be ideal if we had the CODIS upload date for the reference sample that
matched to each SAK. That would allow us to examine and describe the
distribution of the delay between uploading the SAK sample and receiving an
offender match. There would be no delay ($\le 0$ years) when the offender
reference sample was already present in CODIS, but it could be anywhere from 1
day to many years before one is available. Knowing more about that distribution
would allow us to find the subset of potentially preventable incidents that
occurred both after the testing window ended and after the matching reference
sample was uploaded to CODIS.

Unfortunately, we do not have access to those offender reference sample upload
dates. Therefore, we examine the implications of assuming a fixed delay in 
when offender reference samples arrive in CODIS relative to the end of the 
testing window. We do that by using the cumulative distribution functions 
graphed in Figure \ref{fig:plot_IYearsAfterTW_Crime_ecdf} to compute how many 
incidents occurred 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after the end of the testing window. 
This makes the crude assumption that all SAKs experience the same delay.

### Export Figures for Manuscript
The American Psychological Association's 
[general instructions regarding manuscript preparation](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/general-manuscript-preparation-guidelines) 
refer authors to 
[KnowledgeWorks Global Digital Art Support General Guidelines](https://www.kwglobal.com/digital-art-support) for guidance on 
preparing figures. We are complying with those guidelines for preparing the 
following Figure files that we export. 

We can chooose between submitting TIFF versus EPS file. Because EPS files are
orders of magnitude smaller, we choose those for submission. We also export PNG 
files for convenience (they are easier to view without specialized software). 

```{r export_Figure_Crime_Years}
ggsave(filename = here::here("inst/Figure_Crime_Years.eps"), 
       plot = Figure_Crime_Years, device = "eps", dpi = 600,

## Software Information
We use R Markdown to enhance reproducibility. Knitting the source R Markdown 
script *`r knitr:::current_input()`* generates this PDF file containing 
explanatory text, R code, plus R output (text and graphics).

- We used [RStudio](www.rstudio.org) `r rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version` to 
  work with R and R markdown files. The software chain looks like this:
  **Rmd file > RStudio > R > rmarkdown > knitr > pandoc > TinyTeX or MiKTeX > PDF file**.
- We recommend using [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) to compile LaTeX files 
  into PDF files. However, it should be viable to use 
  [MiKTeX version 2.9](https://miktex.org) instead. 
- We used [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) `r pandoc_version()` for this 
  document. 

This document was generated using the following computational environment and 
dependencies: 

``` {r show_citations}

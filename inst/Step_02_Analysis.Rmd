# Purpose
This file analyzes data derived from publicly archived data files (Campbell,
2019) to produce outputs for a descriptive paper about the criminal histories of
suspected serial sexual perpetrators.^[In this document, we use the terms
perpetrator and offender interchangeably. Both terms should be interpreted as
referring to individuals suspected of committing a crime but we occasionally
omit that qualifier for the sake of brevity.] The data come from Detroit, MI.

# Setup
Set global R chunk options (local chunk options will over-ride global options). 
The method for creating a size option that controls font size in code chunks and
their text output is based on an answer to a question posted on   
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25646333/code-chunk-font-size-in-rmarkdown-with-knitr-and-latex/46526740#46526740). 

``` {r global_options, cfsize = "footnotesize"}
# Create a custom chunk hook/option for controlling font size in chunk & output.
def.chunk.hook  <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("chunk")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) {
  x <- def.chunk.hook(x, options)
  ifelse(options$cfsize != "normalsize", paste0("\n \\", options$cfsize,"\n\n", 
                                              x, "\n\n \\normalsize"), x)
  })

# Global chunk options (over-ridden by local chunk options)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include  = TRUE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, 
                      message = TRUE, warning = TRUE, cfsize = "footnotesize")
```

Load R packages that we need to get additional functions. 

``` {r load_packages}
library(here)             # for here()
library(plyr)             # For mapvalues()
library(dplyr)            # for %>%, filter(), group_by(), & summarise()
library(tidyr)            # for arrange(), filter(), group_by(), mutate(),  
                          # spread(), summarise(), %>%, etc. 
library(rmarkdown)        # for render()
library(knitr)            # for kable()
options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)
library(kableExtra)       # for kable_styling(), add_header_above(), column_spec(),
                          # collapse_rows(), and landscape()
library(descr)            # For freq().
options(descr.plot=FALSE) # Make freq() & crosstab() skip plots by default.
library(lubridate)        # For date conversion, eg. ymd(), time_length().
library(sjlabelled)       # For set_label(), get_label()
library(haven)            # for read_spss()
library(lattice)          # For xyplot(), bwplot(), etc. 
library(psych)            # For describe()
library(car)              # For recode()
library(SSACHR)           # for rvlabel()
```

Create objects to hold settings we plan to reuse often. 

```{r my_settings}
# Custom settings for use with bwplot().
my.boxes <- list(box.rectangle = list(col = "black", lwd = 2), 
                 box.umbrella = list(col = "black", lwd = 2))
```

# Offender-Level Summaries
We have few offender-level demographic variables that are worth reporting (we 
will omit summarizing height, weight, hair color, & eye color). After examining
sex, race, and age, we switch focus to looking at descriptive data about the 
criminal history records for arrests, prosecutor charges, and adjudicated 
charges. 

All the CHR summaries in this section focus on variables that have been 
aggregated to offender level. That is why the sample size for all of these
variables is N = `r nrow(IDNEW)` (the number of offenders for whom Michigan CHR 
data were available and the start date for the earliest SAK testing window could
be established). 

\FloatBarrier

## Sex
```{r examine_Sex}
kable(freq(as_factor(IDNEW$Sex)), format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2,

```{r examine_Race}
kable(freq(as_factor(IDNEW$Race), user.missing = "Unknown"), format = "latex", 
      booktabs = TRUE,  digits = 2, caption = "Offender Race")

## CHR Record Counts
We aggregated data to count how many CHR records of each type are associated 
with each offender. We summarize the resulting variables (*NINC*, *NARR*, 
*NCHG*, *NJUD*, & *NCON*) below. Table \ref{tab:describe_rcvars} provides 
overall descriptive statistics for all record types, plus summaries broken down
by when the associated incidents occurred relative to the testing window.

## Crime Category Counts
Table \ref{tab:describe_cccvars} summarizes how many of 12 different categories
of crime each offender was *arrested for*, *charged with*, *convicted of*, and
*arrested for, charged with, or convicted of* according to the CHR data. This
sums a set of binary transforms on the incident count variables associated with
each crime category in *ACat12*, *CCat12*, and *JCat12*. The 
*Excluded user-missing* value is not counted as a category, so the possible
range of values for these counts is 0-12. We report both overall results, and
results broken down by when the incidents associated with the arrest, charge,
and conviction records occurred relative to the earliest testing window.

## Incident Counts by Crime Category (12 levels)
In this section, we analyze variables that contain the number of unique 
incidents in the offender's criminal history for a given type of crime. We have 
four separate counts for each category of crime. The first three represent 
incidents where the offender was *arrested for*, *charged with*, or 
*convicted of* crimes classified into that category. We also include counts of
incidents based on a combined criterion where the offender was 
*arrested for, charged with, or convicted of* (any of the three events, or any 
combination of them) crimes classified into the relevant category.

Note that these variables were created by first aggregating ARR, CHG, and JUD 
records to the incident level to flag incidents that fit the relevant category, 
then aggregated again to get to the offender level incident counts. It is 
possible to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or 
adjudication records for convictions on a single incident, but these variables 
ignore that and only count each incident once. 

The chunk below creates some objects we use to dynamically construct text later 
in the subsections below. 

```{r create_History_Vars}

# Convert those new variables to percentages.

P_HXCat12_12 <- round(100*N_HXCat12_12/nrow(IDNEW), digits = 0)

*arrested for*, *charged with*, and *convicted of* traffic crimes and violations
of ordinances.

### Weapons
Here we summarize the counts of unique incidents where the offender was

### Other Crimes (Excluded User-Missing)
Here we summarize the counts of unique incidents where the offender was 
*arrested for*, *charged with*, and *convicted of* any other type of crime not
included in the other tables above this section.

## Software Information
We use R Markdown to enhance reproducibility. Knitting the source R Markdown 
script *`r knitr:::current_input()`* generates this PDF file containing 
explanatory text, R code, plus R output (text and graphics).

- We used [RStudio](www.rstudio.org) `r rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version` to 
  work with R and R markdown files. The software chain looks like this:
  **Rmd file > RStudio > R > rmarkdown > knitr > pandoc > TinyTeX or MiKTeX > PDF file**.
- We recommend using [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) to compile LaTeX files 
  into PDF files. However, it should be viable to use 
  [MiKTeX version 2.9](https://miktex.org) instead. 
- We used [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) `r pandoc_version()` for this 
  document. 

This document was generated using the following computational environment and 
dependencies: 

``` {r show_citations}
# If is_tineytex = TRUE, then we used TinyTex, otherwise we used MikTeX. 
tinytex:::is_tinytex()

# Get R and R package version numbers in use.
devtools::session_info()
```

The current Git commit details and status are:

```{r git_details, eval=TRUE}
# Store whether git2r is installed and we are in a git repository.
GitCheck <- "git2r" %in% installed.packages() & git2r::in_repository(path = ".")
cat(paste("GitCheck =", GitCheck, "\n"))

# What commit is this file at? 
if (GitCheck) git2r::repository(here::here())

# What is the repository status? 
if (GitCheck) git2r::status()
```

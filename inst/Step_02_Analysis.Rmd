# Purpose
This file analyzes data derived from publicly archived data files (Campbell,
2019) to produce outputs for a descriptive paper about the criminal histories of
suspected serial sexual perpetrators.^[In this document, we use the terms
perpetrator and offender interchangeably. Both terms should be interpreted as
referring to individuals suspected of committing a crime but we occasionally
omit that qualifier for the sake of brevity.] The data come from Detroit, MI.

# Setup
Set global R chunk options (local chunk options will over-ride global options). 
The method for creating a size option that controls font size in code chunks and
their text output is based on an answer to a question posted on   
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25646333/code-chunk-font-size-in-rmarkdown-with-knitr-and-latex/46526740#46526740). 

``` {r global_options, cfsize = "footnotesize"}
# Create a custom chunk hook/option for controlling font size in chunk & output.
def.chunk.hook  <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("chunk")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) {
  x <- def.chunk.hook(x, options)
  ifelse(options$cfsize != "normalsize", paste0("\n \\", options$cfsize,"\n\n", 
                                              x, "\n\n \\normalsize"), x)
  })

# Global chunk options (over-ridden by local chunk options)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include  = TRUE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, 
                      message = TRUE, warning = TRUE, cfsize = "footnotesize")

# Declare location of this script relative to the project root directory.
here::i_am(path = "inst/Step_02_Analysis.Rmd")
```

Load R packages that we need to get additional functions. 

``` {r load_packages}
library(here)             # for here()
library(plyr)             # For mapvalues()
library(dplyr)            # for %>%, filter(), group_by(), & summarise()
library(tidyr)            # for arrange(), filter(), group_by(), mutate(),  
                          # spread(), summarise(), %>%, etc. 
library(rmarkdown)        # for render()
library(knitr)            # for kable()
options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)
library(kableExtra)       # for kable_styling(), add_header_above(), column_spec(),
                          # collapse_rows(), and landscape()
library(descr)            # For freq().
options(descr.plot=FALSE) # Make freq() & crosstab() skip plots by default.
library(lubridate)        # For date conversion, eg. ymd(), time_length().
library(sjlabelled)       # For set_label(), get_label()
library(haven)            # for read_spss()
library(lattice)          # For xyplot(), bwplot(), etc. 
library(latticeExtra)     # for layer()
library(psych)            # For describe()
library(car)              # For recode()

library(geepack)          # for geeglm()
library(emmeans)          # for emmeans()
```

Create objects to hold settings we plan to reuse often. 

```{r my_settings}
# Custom settings for use with bwplot().
my.boxes <- list(box.rectangle = list(col = "black", lwd = 2), 
                 box.umbrella = list(col = "black", lwd = 2))

# Offender-Level Summaries
We have few offender-level demographic variables that are worth reporting (we 
will omit summarizing height, weight, hair color, & eye color). After examining
sex, race, and age, we switch focus to looking at descriptive data about the 
criminal history records for arrests, prosecutor charges, and adjudicated 
charges. 

All the CHR summaries in this section focus on variables that have been 
aggregated to the offender level. That is why the sample size for all of these
variables is N = `r nrow(IDNEW)` (the number of offenders for whom Michigan CHR 
data were available and the start date for the earliest SAK testing window could
be established). 

\FloatBarrier

## Sex
```{r examine_Sex}
kable(freq(as_factor(IDNEW$Sex)), format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2,
      caption = "Offender Sex")

```

## CHR Periods
The observed portions of these offenders' adult criminal histories include 
incident, arrest, prosecutor charge, and judicial charge records associated with
crimes that occurred between the offender's 16th birthday and April 15, 2016
(when the CHR data were collected from the official statewide CHR database). 
That time frame can be divided into three important periods for the purposes of
this study: before, during, and after the testing window associated with the 
offender's earliest sexual assault kit (SAK). Here we provide descriptive data 
about those periods. Note that for offenders whose earliest SAK was collected 
before their 16th birthday, the before period was set to both start and end the 
day before the SAK was collected to make sure that it had a duration of zero 
years because it was effectively unobserved. 


```{r boxplot_Age16Date, fig.height = 1.75, fig.cap=FCap}
# Figure caption.
FCap <- paste("Box Plot for Date of Offender's 16th Birtday. Only offenders", 
              "with valid testing window start dates are included.")

bwplot(~ Age16Date, data = IDNEW, factor = 9, 
       xlim = c(ymd("1950-01-01"), ymd("2020-12-31")),
       panel = panel.mybox, par.settings = my.boxes,
       xlab = "Offender's 16th Birthday")
```


```{r describe_windows}
rlabs <- c("Before testing window", "During testing window", "After testing window")

IDNEW %>% 
  select(DurationBP, DurationDP, DurationAP) %>% 
  describe(., quant=c(.25, .50, .75)) %>% 
  bind_cols(data.frame(Variable = rlabs), .) %>% 
  select(Variable, n, mean, sd, min, max, skew, kurtosis, Q0.25, Q0.5, Q0.75) %>% 
  kable(., format = "html", booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2, row.names = FALSE,
      col.names = c("Variable", CNames),
      caption = "Durations (Years)")

```





## CHR Record Counts
We aggregated data to count how many CHR records of each type are associated
with each offender. Here we are counting only records associated with incidents
for which the offender was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of at least
one offense from the 12 main crime categories. We summarize the resulting
variables (*NINC12*, *NARR12*, *NCHG12*, *NJUD12*, & *NCON12*) below. Table
\ref{tab:describe_rcvars} provides overall descriptive statistics for all record
types, plus summaries broken down by when the associated incidents occurred
relative to the testing window.

## Crime Category Counts (Arrested, Charged, or Convicted)
Table \ref{tab:describe_cccvars} summarizes how many of 12 different crime 
categories each offender was *arrested for, charged with, or convicted of*
according to the CHR data. This sums a set of binary transforms on the incident
count variables associated with each crime category in *HXCat12*. It is possible
to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or conviction records 
for a specific category, but we only count each distinct category once at most.
The *Excluded user-missing* value is not counted as a category, so the possible
range of values for these counts is 0-12. We report both overall results, and
results broken down by when the incidents associated with the arrest, charge,
and conviction records occurred relative to the earliest testing window. Table \ref{tab:freq_HXCat12_Count} shows the frequency distributions underlying those
summaries.

## Incident Counts by Crime Category (12 levels)
In this section, we analyze variables that contain the number of unique 
incidents in the offender's criminal history for a given type of crime. For each
category of crime, we report include counts of incidents based on a combined 
criterion where the offender was *arrested for, charged with, or convicted of* 
(any of the three events, or any combination of them) crimes classified into the
relevant category.

Note that these variables were created by first aggregating *ARR*, *CHG*, and
*JUD* records to the incident level to flag incidents that fit the relevant
category, then aggregated again to get to the offender level incident counts. It
is possible to have multiple arrest offense records, charge records, or
adjudication records for convictions on a single incident, but these variables
ignore that and only count each incident once.

The chunk below creates some objects we use to dynamically construct text later 
in the subsections below. 

```{r create_History_Vars}

P_HXCat12_12 <- round(100*N_HXCat12_12/nrow(IDNEW), digits = 0)

## Software Information
We use R Markdown to enhance reproducibility. Knitting the source R Markdown 
script *`r knitr:::current_input()`* generates this PDF file containing 
explanatory text, R code, plus R output (text and graphics).

- We used [RStudio](www.rstudio.org) `r rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version` to 
  work with R and R markdown files. The software chain looks like this:
  **Rmd file > RStudio > R > rmarkdown > knitr > pandoc > TinyTeX or MiKTeX > PDF file**.
- We recommend using [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) to compile LaTeX files 
  into PDF files. However, it should be viable to use 
  [MiKTeX version 2.9](https://miktex.org) instead. 
- We used [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) `r pandoc_version()` for this 
  document. 

This document was generated using the following computational environment and 
dependencies: 

``` {r show_citations}
# If is_tineytex = TRUE, then we used TinyTex, otherwise we used MikTeX. 
tinytex:::is_tinytex()

# Get R and R package version numbers in use.
devtools::session_info()
```

The current Git commit details and status are:

```{r git_details, eval=TRUE}
# Store whether git2r is installed and we are in a git repository.
GitCheck <- "git2r" %in% installed.packages() & git2r::in_repository(path = ".")
if(!GitCheck) cat(paste0("GitCheck = ", GitCheck, 
                         ". Version control details not available. \n"))

# What commit is this file at?
